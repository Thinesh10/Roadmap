is_trivially_copyable_v: with no potential overlapping subobjects are the only ones that are can safely use memcpy

std::memcpy : works on bytes (target start, source start, size in bytes)

std::ranges::move : (source start iter, source end iter, target start iter)

implement both const and non const for [] operator: standard for std::array and std::vector implementations to allow for both read only and const returns
