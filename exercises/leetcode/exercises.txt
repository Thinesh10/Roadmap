  1. Return indices of two numbers that add up to target sum.
  2. Sum of two numbers in linked list format.
  3. Longest substring without repeated letters.
  4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays. 
      - std::ranges::sort is inplace
      - consider binary search on both vectors (moving cut)

09 Sep 2025:
  5. Longest Palindromic Substring
      - Use 2D table, use previously computed palindromes to expand on. 

13 Sep 2025:
  6. Zigzag conversion
	  - std::ranges::views::filter(lambda) : newly come across to filter out selected data based on lambda

25 Sep 2025:
  7. Reverse integer
	  - mod of negative number is same as positive

26 Sep 2025:
  8: String to integer (atoi)
	  - std::ranges::find_if_not
	  - std::from_chars (handles leading negative) returns error e.g. std::errc::result_out_of_range
	  - if std::string_view can use s.remove_prefix(i) 
	  - static_cast char to unsigned char before using std::isdigit to avoid UB
