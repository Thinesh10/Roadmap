If running a business:
  - income
  - expenses
  - assets
  - liabilities 
  - cashflow

"cash burn"

Financial statements:
  - income statement: revenue 
      - cost of sales = gross profit - operating costs = net profit - tax - NPAT (net profit after tax)
      - EBITDA - earnings before interest tax depreciation amortisation
          - remove DA because not cash (A is D for non physical assets e.g. software)
          - remove IT because doesn't really tell you how profitable your business is
      
  - balance shee / statement of financial position:
          - assets: receivables, cash, PPE, intangible assets, goodwill
          - liabilities: payables, debt, provisions (any expected outflow), deferred revenue
              - expenses are things you incur during a specific period of time, liabilities are things you expect to incur in the future
          - equity: difference between assets and liabilities
            - revenue / income 
            - expenses
            - capital
            - CLI = AE (CLI up credit and other options)
    
  - cashflow statement - how much cash you've generated / cost you over the year:
    - operating: operations of the business
    - investing: buying / selling assets
    - financing: how the company is financed (interest, cash)
